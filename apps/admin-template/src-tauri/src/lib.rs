//! Banto admin template — Tauri entry point.
//!
//! Thin `tauri::command` adapters only (spec §10): all real logic lives in
//! `admin-template-core` (`apps/admin-template/core`) and `banto-server`
//! (`crates/banto-server`), neither of which has a `tauri` dependency, so
//! both are exercised by plain `cargo test` in environments (e.g. CI
//! containers without webkit2gtk) that cannot build this crate. This file
//! CANNOT be compiled in that same environment - keep changes here small,
//! mechanical, and easy to eyeball-verify against the crates it wires
//! together.
//!
//! M6 Phase B (spec §11) adds the embedded LAN server's lifecycle to this
//! crate: `AppState` gains the settings service, the app-wide
//! resource-change broadcast channel, the embedded server's own auth state,
//! and a slot for the currently-running server (if LAN access is enabled).
//! `setup()` forwards every broadcast event onto the webview via Tauri's own
//! event system (`banto://event`) - this is `TauriEventProvider`'s other
//! half (`packages/admin-core/src/events.ts`) - and auto-starts the server
//! if it was left enabled on a previous run.
