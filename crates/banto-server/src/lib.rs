//! Banto server: embedded HTTP server for LAN browser access (spec §11).
//!
//! Domain-agnostic only: auth/token management, CSRF header enforcement,
//! baseline security response headers, SSE event fan-out, static/SPA
//! fallback serving, server lifecycle (bind/serve/graceful-shutdown), plus
//! (since theme C PR-C4, docs/template-scope.md §7 移行順 ④) the REST
//! routers for the resources that are themselves domain-agnostic
//! ([`routes`]: auth extras, users, audit-log, backups, ui-settings, backed
//! by `banto-admin-services`). Anything that knows about a specific APP
//! resource (`items`, `attachments`) or the frontend build's on-disk
//! location lives in the app crate (`apps/admin-template/core`), which
//! composes these pieces via [`auth::auth_routes`], [`events::sse_route`],
//! [`routes`], [`static_files::static_router`], [`response::ApiError`] and
//! [`security_headers::with_security_headers`].
//!
//! Every router built here stays `Router<()>` (no shared `axum::State`):
//! handlers close over their state (`AuthState`, `broadcast::Sender`, ...)
//! instead, so routers from different modules merge without state-type
//! conflicts.
