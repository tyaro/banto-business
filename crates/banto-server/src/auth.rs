//! Token-based authentication for the embedded server (spec §11.2).
//!
//! There is no secure-cookie story for a plain-HTTP LAN server, so the
//! bearer token is handed back in the login response body and the frontend
//! is responsible for attaching `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every
//! subsequent request (mirrors `HttpDataProvider`'s planned wire contract,
//! spec §3.2/§11.1).
//!
//! Two hardening measures live here beyond plain "is this token known":
//!
//! - **Token expiry** ([`TokenPolicy`]): tokens carry an issue time and a
//!   last-used time and are invalidated once they exceed either an absolute
//!   lifetime (default 8h) or an idle timeout (default 1h, refreshed on every
//!   `verify`/`identity_for`). Without this a session lives forever until an
//!   explicit `logout`, and abandoned sessions accumulate in memory unbounded.
//!   Each token individually opts into a second, much longer-lived policy
//!   (spec M11 "LAN Remember me"): a token issued with `remember: true` is
//!   evaluated against `AuthState`'s `remembered_policy` (default 30d
//!   absolute / 7d idle) instead of the regular `token_policy` for the rest
//!   of its life - see [`TokenRecord::remembered`].
//! - **Login rate limiting** ([`RateLimitPolicy`]): consecutive failed
//!   `POST /api/auth/login` attempts trip a short lockout (default 60s) along
//!   two dimensions - per (IP + username) at 5 failures, and per IP alone at
//!   20 failures. Because credential verification runs a deliberately
//!   expensive argon2id hash even for an unknown username (spec §8.2's
//!   dummy-hash timing defense), an unthrottled login endpoint is also a
//!   CPU-exhaustion DoS, not just a brute-force one; the per-IP dimension is
//!   what stops that from being evaded by rotating the `username` field (see
//!   [`RateLimitPolicy`]).
//!
//! Expired tokens and stale failure records are reaped lazily (on lookup) and
//! opportunistically (a cheap sweep on each write); there is deliberately no
//! background reaper task, to keep this a plain library type with no owned
//! runtime.
