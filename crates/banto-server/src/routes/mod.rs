//! Domain-agnostic REST routers (docs/template-scope.md §7 移行順 ④, theme C
//! PR-C4): the `/api/auth/*` extras, `/api/users/*`, `/api/audit-log/*`,
//! `/api/backups/*` and `/api/ui-settings/*` sub-routers, plus the RBAC/audit
//! wiring helpers they share with the app's own routers.
//!
//! These used to live in `admin-template-core::rest` - i.e. in the surface a
//! template adopter copies and then owns forever. Nothing here mentions
//! `items` (or any other app resource), so it is exactly the slice that
//! should be a dependency instead: an adopter keeps `/api/items/*` and the
//! `api_router` assembly (the `.merge()` calls) and gets everything below
//! for free.
//!
//! The routers are pure wiring: they take already-built
//! [`banto_admin_services`] service handles plus this crate's
//! [`AuthState`] and return `Router<()>` (handlers close
//! over their state - see this crate's module doc comment), so the app's
//! `api_router` can `.merge()` them without state-type conflicts. The
//! services themselves stay axum-free (conventions §2); authorization
//! ([`RoleGuard`]/[`require_role_at_least`], spec M10) and audit recording
//! ([`record_write`], spec M14) are added here.
//!
//! ## Both-paths symmetry (conventions §1)
//!
//! The route table these routers implement is documented in
//! `admin-template-core::rest`'s module doc comment (the artifact §1 names
//! as the REST side of the Tauri⇔REST correspondence table), and
//! `scripts/verify-architecture.mjs` rule 8 cross-checks that doc against
//! the actual `.route("…")` declarations here as well as in the app's
//! `rest/` directory. Moving a router between the two directories is
//! therefore invisible to that check by design - what must never change is
//! the method+path+role floor of each route.
